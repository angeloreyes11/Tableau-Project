# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
With over 17 thousand FIFA players and 70 different attributes attached to each player, my main focus for this project was to analyze, gain insight and create visualizations that will help me filter out top players from low level players. Growing up playing FIFA your eyes immediately get drawn to player stats and team stats. You would be wanting to play your friends using the best statistical team in the game. That was the primary objective for while completing this project. It was to display the best of the best players of FIFA 2018.
