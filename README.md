# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

With over 17 thousand FIFA players and 70 different attributes attached to each player, my main focus for this project was to analyze, gain insight and create visualizations that will help me filter out top players from low level players. Growing up playing FIFA your eyes immediately get drawn to player stats and team stats. You would be wanting to play your friends using the best statistical team in the game. That was the primary objective for while completing this project. It was to display the best of the best players of FIFA 2018. 

How can we do that?
 - Explore and to get familiarize with each data we are dealing with. (ie. All different attributes for each player)
 - Condense it into categories easier to read and interpret. (ie. Position stats such as ST, CM, LW, CB, RB, and soo on are combined into Forward, Defender,     Goalkeeper)
 - Build data visualizations to help achieve my project objective. This is done using show-me tables, heatmaps and analytical data visualization such as clusters.
 - Create dashboards and stories to create a flow to illustrate and answer our desired questions about this data set.

## Process

## Step 1: Data Loading and Analyzation 

- Out of the 5 options for our project we chose the FIFA 18 Player Ratings.
- Using the data set provided, navigate through Tableau to download said data set into the workbook.
- Within the data source tab, familiarize through each different columns of data to distinguish which we can use for analyzation. 

## Step 2: Build Visualization Graphs and Table

- Using Tableau worksheet, create interactive data graphs and tables with the given data.
- Include filters options to interact with the visualization.
- Integrate parameters and calculated fields to combine sets of data into smaller, more readable attribute.

## Step 3: Formulate Questions 

- Once we understand the data we have, create questions that we want to answer.
- What are some graphs or tables that we have generated that might answer these questions? Any anylitical models we can use to further explain the data?

## Step 4: Create Dashboards and Stories

- Using Tableau Dashboards, create an interactive dashboard that represent a better story and flow.
- Here we are to answer the questions we want to answer using the graphs or tables we generated. 

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

The chosen option was the data list of FIFA 18 Player Rankings which was one of the options for option 2.
